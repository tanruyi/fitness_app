# Project Title
Welcome! This is a website called Fitness App.

# Project Description
This website allows users to search for exercises based on exercise name, target muscle, body part or equipment. GIFs for each exercise are also available to demonstrate how to perform the exercise.

This is a website created using the following languages:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript 

The following libraries were used as well:
- React
- Material UI
- React Horizontal Scrolling Menu
- React Loader Spinner
- React Router

APIs used in this project:
- [ExerciseDB](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb?utm_source=youtube.com%2FJavaScriptMastery&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=DevRel) from RapidAPI
- [Youtube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) from Google

Styling was completed using CSS stylesheets and Material UI.

This project was created as part of the course requirements for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp.

Potential new features to be added in the future:
- Saving past exercise records for each exercise, including details such as date of exercise, number of sets, number of reps, and weight used etc.
- Creating a new event in Google calendar with the click of a button, with details of the workout auto-populated in the description section
- Make it media responsive to mobile phones
